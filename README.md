# Detection of Stop Signs
Convolutation neural networks, image recognition, deep learning, machine learning

## Goals:
- Detection of stop signs
- Identify distance and speed from stop sign

We plan to develop an algorithm and program to distinguish the presence of a stop sign in a photograph.  We will use neural networks and image/object recognition.  As stated in class, tackling the case of machine learning or facial recognition in autonomous cars in ten weeks will be unfeasible, we opted for a related but more simple goal.  Specifically, we hope to use images from current datasets and combine our own pictures scraped from Google images as training data.  This will ideally utilize our web scraping skills.  For Goal 2, we will use the Youtube API as well as video data set (Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles video dataset) to determine the distance from and time from stop sign.

So why are we doing this? Object recognition and machine/computer vision have many applications.  For example, it can be used to substitute labor and more efficiently complete a job.  In our case, stop sign recognition is a very introductory foundation for autonomous cars.  Stakeholders include 

## Questions of Interest 
- Is there a stop sign in view?
- If so, how far is the sign?  
- How fast is the camera moving relative to the position of the stop sign
