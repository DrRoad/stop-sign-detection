# Detection of Stop Signs

## Goals:
- Identify the best method to detect stop signs
- Expand this method to identify speed limit signs
- Frame by frame analysis of stop signs (Bayesian Inference)

We plan to develop an algorithm and program to distinguish the presence of a stop sign in a photograph.  We will use neural networks and image/object recognition.  As stated in class, tackling the case of machine learning or facial recognition in autonomous cars in ten weeks will be unfeasible, we opted for a related but more simple goal.  Specifically, we hope to use images from current datasets to discover the best method for identification.

Methods in Consideration:
- Neural Networks
- Random Forrest Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression

So why are we doing this? Object recognition and machine/computer vision have many applications.  For example, it can be used to substitute labor and more efficiently complete a job.  In our case, stop sign recognition is a very introductory foundation for autonomous cars.
